# NY-MVC-Sinatra-App

##Usage
An app for Migrants or Refugees to post experiences with specific organizations in NY.  Initially set up with only four organizations in the database, though this list can be expanded in "./db/seeds.rb"

To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
